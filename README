This is a modified version of the PANDA code described below.
It includes the possibility to run the Adjacency Decomposition Method in Parallel.
Additionally this version communicates with GAP to perform fast equivalence checks.
Thus this modified version enumerates faces of a Polytope up to some symmetry.

SETUP for COMMUNICATION with GAP:
This program communicates with GAP via named pipes. These pipes are essentially files, which can be created using
"mkpipe"- command. For this program we need to communication pipes, which are:
a) mkpipe fromgap.pipe
b) mkpipe togap.pipe

In the source code in this repository, the paths to these pipes have to be modified to run it on your computer.
There is just one place, where this path has to be edited. After you changed these paths to your pipes, you can install
RANDA.


INSTALLATION:
a) mkdir build && cd build
b) cmake .. && make && make install

USAGE:
Before you  run RANDA, make sure you have started the GAP program for equivalence tests.
You can execute RANDA by simply calling "randa testfile.ext" from the Terminal.

The following flags are available:
-r : Recursion Depth (standard 0)
-t : Number of threads (standard given by system)

PANDA -- Parallel AdjaceNcy Decomposition Algorithm

Detailed information available at http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/PANDA

I. PREREQUISITES

1. Compiler

a) known compatibility

PANDA was tested on Linux and Mac OS X systems using the following compilers:
g++-4.7
g++-4.8
g++-4.9
g++-5
clang++-3.4
clang++-3.5
clang++-3.6

b) known incompatibility

PANDA cannot be compiled with the following compilers:
g++ up to 4.6
clang++ up to 3.3

2. Build system

Either gnumake or CMake is required to compile PANDA with the help of Makefiles.
Building manually, all files in the src directory have to be compiled and then linked.
Threading capability is required (i.e. "-pthread" on Linux systems).
Building manually with support for MPI requires the definition of the macro "MPI_SUPPORT".

3. MPI

MPI is optional. Even if installed, it can be deactivated by the user.
See below for instructions.



II. INSTALLATION

 1. using CMake
   a) create a folder called "build" and enter it (linux: mkdir build; cd build)
   b) call "cmake .."
   c) run "make"
   d) run "ctest" (optional)
   e) run "make install" (optional. to select the installation path, please refer to the cmake help)

   If you do not have ctest installed, PANDA will probably still work fine. If you want to execute the tests without ctest, simply execute every binary in the build directory (exluding PANDA itself).

   You will find an executable called "panda" in the build directory (or in the installation directory if you called "make install").

 2. without CMake (not recommended)
   a) run "./configure"
   b) run "make"



III. USAGE

 For information on how to use panda, see our website http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/PANDA
 Calling panda --help provides information on how to use command line parameters.
 Calling panda --version provides version information of your installation.



IV. TROUBLESHOOTING

 1. Debug build
  a) CMake: run "cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .." and re-compile.
  b) Manual build: edit "Makefile_configuration.mk" and re-compile.

 2. Further information

 3. Bug reports
  If you have a bug report, you may contact the developer (stefan.loerwald+panda@gmail.com).
  Please include the version information and a detailed description of the error (include data files if necessary).

Note that in general, we do not give any support for PANDA.
Usage is at own risk.
